[Java](https://go.java/index.html) is among the most popular available programming languages, thanks to its versatility and compatibility. It is widely used for software development, mobile applications, and large systems development.

Besides it is not that young as the fresh languages out there, Java which was born in 1995 and is maintained by [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html) was designed to be fast, secure, reliable, beginner-friendly and highly portable. This portability perk exists as it must be execute through a cross-platform compatible [Java Virtual Machine - JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine). Android apps are also developer using Java, since the [Android Operating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) runs on a Java language environment.

The Java community size is huge (GitHub for example has over 1.5 million Java projects, also mentioning that Java has the second larger community in [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java))! This is important because the larger a programming language community is, the more support you'd be likely to get.

From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, [Java is everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere)! There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed (yes, we are talking about that lovely orange icon who always ask to update itself time to time!).
